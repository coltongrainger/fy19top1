### [@Mu00, number 30.4]

Every compact metrizable space $X$ has a countable basis.^[Hint: let $\sA_n$ be a finite covering of $X$ by $1/n$-balls]

\newpage

### [@Mu00, number 30.6]

The lower limit topology $\RR_\ell$ is not metrizable.
The ordered square $I_o^2$ is not metrizable.

\newpage

### [@Mu00, number 30.13]

If $X$ has a countable dense subset, every collection of disjoint open sets in $X$ is countable.

\newpage

### [@Mu00, number 31.5]

If $Y$ is Hausdorff and $f,g \colon X \to Y$ are continuous maps, then $\{x : f(x) = g(x)\}$ is closed in $X$.

\newpage

### [@Mu00, number 31.6]

If $X$ is normal, and $p \colon X \to Y$ is a closed continuous surjective map, then $Y$ is normal.^[Hint: if $U$ is an open set containing $p^{-1}(\{y\})$, there's a neighborhood $W$ of $y$ such that $p^{-1}(W) \subset U$.]

\newpage

### [@Mu00, number 51.3]

Let $[X,Y]$ denote the set of homotopy classes of maps of $X$ into $Y$. A space $X$ is said to be *contractible* if the identity map $i_X \colon X \to X$ is nulhomotopic.

(a) The interval $I$ and the real line $\RR$ are both contractible.
(b) A contractible space is path connected.
(c) If $Y$ is contractible, then for any $X$, the set $[X,Y]$ has a single element.
(d) If $X$ is contractible and $Y$ is path connected, then $[X,Y]$ has a single element.

\newpage

### [@Mu00, number 52.4]

Let $A \subset X$; suppose $r \colon X \to A$ is a continuous map such that $r(a) = a$ for each $a \in A$. The map $r$ is called a retraction of $X$ onto $A$. If $a_0 \in A$, then $r_* \colon \pi_1(X, a_0) \to \pi_1(A, a_0)$ is surjective.
