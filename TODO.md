### Quotienting out $K$ in the $K$-topology [@Mu00, number 22.6]

Let $Y$ be the quotient space obtained from $\RR_K$ by collapsing the set $K$ to point, with $p \colon \RR_K \to Y$ as the corresponding quotient map.

(a) $Y$ is $T_1$ but not Hausdorff.
(b) The map $p \times p \colon \RR_K \times\RR_K \to Y \times Y$ is not a quotient map.^[The diagonal is not closed in $Y \times Y$, but its inverse image is closed in $\RR_K \times \RR_K$.]

### [@Mu00, number 25.5]

Let $X$ denote the rational points of the interval $[0,1]\times 0$ of $\RR^2$. Let $T$ denote the union of all line segments joining the point $p = 0 \times 1$ to points of $X$.

(a) $T$ is path connected---but only locally connected at the point $p$.
(b) We exhibit a subset of $\RR^2$ that is path connected but is locally connected at none of it's points.

### [@Mu00, number 25.7] 

The closed infinite broom $X$ is not locally connected at the point at the endpoint $p$, but is weakly locally connected at $p$.

### 2018-10-10 midterm problem 2

(a) Let $\sN = \{1/n : n \in \NN\} \subset \RR$ denote the set of all reciprocals of natural numbers. Let $$\sB = \{(a,b) : a,b \in \RR\} \cup \{(a,b) \setminus \sN : a,b \in \RR\} \cup \{\RR, \emptyset\}.$$ 
Now $\sB$ generates a topology on $\RR$, denote that topology $\sT_\sB$. 

    (i) What is the closure of $\sN$ in $\sT_\sB$?
    (ii) Is every closed set of the topological space $(\RR, \sT_\sB)$ closed in the standard topology on $\RR$?

(b) Is every closed set of the standard topology on $\RR$ also closed in the finite complement topology on $\RR$?
