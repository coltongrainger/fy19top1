### The topology generated by a basis [@Mu00, number 13.5]

If $\sB$ is a basis for a topology on $X$, then the topology generated by $\sB$ equals the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that contain $\sB$. 

*Proof by set inclusion.* ($\subset$) Suppose $\sB$ is a basis for and $\sT_\sB$ is the topology generated by $\sB$, i.e., the set of unions of of families of $B_i \in \sB$. Now, if $U$ is open in $\sT_\sB$, then $U = \cup B_i$. If $\sT_j$ is any other topology on $X$ such that $\sT_j \supset \sB$, because $\sT_j$ is closed under unions of open sets, we have $$U = \cup B_i \in \sT_j.$$ So $\sT_\sB \subset \sT_j$ for all topologies $\sT_j \supset \sB$ on $X$. Hence $$\sT_\sB \subset \bigcap_{\forall\sT_j \supset \sB} \sT_j.$$

($\supset$) Now suppose that the open set $$V \in \bigcap_{\forall\sT_j \supset \sB} \sT_j.$$ We need to show that $V \in \sT_\sB$. But $V \in \sT_j$ for all topologies containing $\sB$. Since $\sT_\sB \supset \sB$ by construction, $V \in \sT_\sB$. So the topology generated by the basis $\sT_\sB$ is in the intersection of all topologies $\sT_j$ containing the basis. \qedsymbol

Further, the same result holds if $\sA$ is a subbasis.

*Proof by set inclusion*. ($\subset$) Let $U$ be an open set in the topology generated by the sub-basis $\sA$, denoted $\sT_\sA$. Then $U$ is the union of finite intersections of sets $A_i$ in the sub-basis. Now note that if $\sT_j$ is a topology on $X$ and $\sT_j \supset \sA$, because $\sT_j$ is closed under unions and finite intersections, we have $U \in \sT_j$. So $\sT_\sA$ for all such topologies on $X$ containing the sub-basis. Whence $$\sT_\sA \subset \bigcap_{\sT_j \supset \sA} \sT_j.$$ 

($\supset$) Let $U \in \sT_j$ for all topologies $\sT_j$ containing $\sA$. Clearly $\sT_\sA$ is one such topology. So $U \in \sT_\sA$. Whence $\sT_\sA$ is contained in the intersection of all $\sT_j$ containing the sub-basis $\sA$. \qedsymbol

### Incomparable topologies on $\RR$ [@Mu00, number 13.6]

We show two topologies on the real line are not comparable, namely $\sT_\ell$, the lower limit topology generated by half open intervals $[a, b)$, and $\sT_K$, the $K$-topology generated by the punctured open intervals $(a,b) \setminus \{n^{-1} : n \in \NN\}$. First, a lemma.

**Lemma.** The lower limit topology $\sT_\ell$ and the $K$-topology $\sT_K$ are strictly finer than the standard topology on $\RR$.

*Proof sketch.* Note the basis of the $K$-topology contains the basis for the standard topology. For the lower limit topology, verify that every standard basis element $(a,b)$ in $\RR$ can be written as the countable union of lower limit basis elements $\left[a+\frac1n, b\right)$ for $n \in \NN$.

Now to show that the lower limit topology and the $K$-topology are not comparable, we'll show that neither one is a subset of the other.

*Demonstration.* Consider $U = [-1,0) \in \sT_\ell$. Is $U$ open in $\sT_K$? No, for take $-1 \in U$ and suppose that any basis element $B_K$ of the $K$-topology contains $-1$. Then there's an $\eps > 0$ such that $-1-\eps \in B_K$, whence $B_K \not\subset U$. So $U$ does not have the property that every point in $U$ can be contained in a basis element $B_K$ that is contained in $U$. Since the $B_K$ are basis element of the $K$-topology, we conclude that $U$ is not an $K$-topology open set. 

On the other hand, consider $V =(-1, 1) \setminus \{1/n : n \in \NN\}$, an open set in $\sT_K$. For contradiction, suppose that $V$ is open in the lower limit topology. Then for all points in the open set $V$ there's a basis element of the form $[a,b)$ containing the point and nested in $V$. Take $0 \in V$ and suppose that $B$ is a lower limit basis element for which $0 \in B \subset V$. Now we have $B = [a,b)$ for some $b > 0$. By the archimedean principle, there exists a natural number $1/n < b$, so $1/n \in B$. But $1/n \notin V$ so $B \not\subset V$, as desired for our contradiction. Whence $V$ is not open in the lower limit topology.

### Partially ordering topologies [@Mu00, number 13.7]

There's a natural partial ordering (by inclusion) for the following topologies on $\RR$:

- the standard topology
- the $K$-topology
- the finite complement topology
- the upper limit topology
- the topology generated by the rays $(-\infty, a)$

The structure of the poset is given by the Hasse diagram, with the finest topologies at top.

```
  upper limit topology
          |
      K topology
          | 
   standard topology
    /             \
ray topology     finite complement
                  topology
```

To offer brief justification. 

1. The upper limit topology contains all standard basis elements (e.g., as infinite unions of the form $(a,b-1/n]$ for all natural numbers $n$). Moreover, the upper limit topology contains all $K$-topology basis elements since $(a,0]$ is open in the upper limit topology (verify).

2. We have that the $K$-topology is finer than the standard topology by the above lemma.

3. We know the standard topology contains the ray topology because every ray basis element $(-\infty, a)$ is open in the standard topology.

4. We know the standard topology contains the finite complement topology because every set of real numbers with a finite complement (say, $n$ distinct points) is the union of finitely many open intervals (e.g., $(-\infty,r_1)\cup(r_1,r_2)\cup\cdots\cup(r_n,\infty)$).

5. The finite complement topology and the ray topology are not comparable as 

  - $(-\infty, a)$ has no finite complement and 
  - $(-\infty,a)\cup(a,\infty)$ cannot be represented as a union of rays.

### Countable bases for topologies on $\RR$ [@Mu00, number 13.8]

(a) $\sB = \{(a,b) : a < b \text{ and } a, b \in \QQ\}$ is a countable basis for the standard topology on $\RR$.

*Proof.* Suppose $U$ is open in $\RR$ and take $x \in U$. Now, since the open balls are a basis for the standard topology, there's an $\eps > 0$ such that the open ball around $x$ of radius $\eps$ satisfies $x \in B_\eps(x) \subset U$. By the archimedean principle, there exists a natural number $n$ and (with help from the division algorithm) a rational number $p$ such that $$\frac1n < \frac\eps2 \text{ and } \abs{p - x} < \frac\eps4.$$ Now the rational ball $(p - 1/n, p + 1/n)$ contains $x$ (one should verify) and is nested in $B_\eps(x)$ (verify). So the rational balls are a basis for $\RR$. Further, since the rational open balls are parameterized by two countable sets, they themselves are countable. \qedsymbol

(b) The collection $\sC = \{[a,b) : a < b \text{ and } a, b \in \QQ\}$ generates a topology distinct from the lower limit topology.

*Demonstration.* We have $[\pi, b) \in \sT_\ell$, the lower limit topology, but $[\pi,b) \notin \sC$. Why? Suppose for contradiction that $[\pi,b)\in\sT_\ell$. Since $[\pi,b)$ is an open set there's some basis element $[r,s)$ containing the point $\pi$ where $r$ and $s$ are rational. But since $\pi \neq r$, and since we can't have $\pi < r$ (recall $\pi\in[r,s)$ as a basis element), it must be that $r < \pi$. But then $[r,s) \not\subset [\pi,b)$, our desired contradiction.

### Defining open sets in a subspace [@Mu00, number 16.3]

Consider the set $Y = [-1, 1]$ as a subspace of $\RR$. Which of the following sets are open in $Y$? in $\RR$?

parameters | union of intervals | open in $\RR$? | open in $Y$?
--- | --- | --- | ---
$\left\{ x : \frac12 < \abs{x} < 1\right\}$ |     $(-1,-\frac12)\cup(\frac12,1)$ | yes | yes
$\left\{ x : \frac12 < \abs{x} \leq 1\right\}$ |  $[-1,-\frac12)\cup(\frac12,1]$ | no | yes
$\left\{ x : \frac12 \leq \abs{x} < 1\right\}$ |  $(-1,-\frac12]\cup[\frac12,1)$ | no | no
$\left\{ x : \frac12 \leq \abs{x} \leq 1\right\}$|$[-1,-\frac12]\cup[\frac12,1]$ | no | no
$\left\{ x : 0 < \abs{x} < 1 \text{ and } \frac1x \notin \NN \right\}$ | $(-1,0) \cup \left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty\left(\frac1{n+1},\frac1n\right)\right)$ | yes | yes

### Open maps between spaces [@Mu00, number 16.4]

Consider a space $X$ and its subspace $Y$. The projections $$\pi_1 \colon X \times Y \to X \text{ and } \pi_2 \colon X \times Y \to Y$$ are open maps.

*Proof.* Suppose $U\times V$ is open in $X\times Y$ (so $U$ and $V$ are open in $X$ and $Y$ respectively). Then $\pi_1(U\times V) = U$ is open in $X$, and $\pi(U\times V) = V$ is open in $Y$. Since open sets are mapped to open sets by both projections, we say both projections are *open maps*. \qedsymbol

### A countable basis for $\RR^2$ [@Mu00, number 16.6]

The countable collection $$\left\{(a,b) \times (c,d) : a < b \text { and } c < d \text{ and } a,b,c,d \in \QQ \right\}$$ is a basis for $\RR^2$.

*Proof.* We are to show that for an arbitrary open $U \in \RR^2$, for each $x \in U$ there's a rational rectangle containing $x$ and embedded in $U$. Now, the open balls are a basis for $\RR^2$, so we know there exists and $\eps > 0$ such that $x \in B_\eps(x) \subset U$. We need to fit our rational rectangle within $B_\eps(x)$.

Now, consider the vector form of $x$ as $(x_1,x_2)^T$. Choose a rational $r = (r_1,r_2)^T$ such that $$\frac{\eps}{3\sqrt{2}} > \max\big\{\abs{x_1-r_1}, \abs{x_2 - r_2}\big\}.$$

Then take the rational rectangle (a product of rational open intervals) $$B_\QQ = \left(r_1 - \frac{2\eps}{3\sqrt{2}}, r_1 + \frac{2\eps}{3\sqrt{2}}\right) \times \left(r_2 - \frac{2\eps}{3\sqrt{2}}, r_2 + \frac{2\eps}{3\sqrt{2}}\right).$$ I claim that $B_\QQ \in B_\eps(x)$ since the boundary of $B_\QQ$ at most coincides with the boundary of $B_\eps(x)$ at one point (verify). By construction $x \in B_\QQ$, so all together we have $x \in B_\QQ \subset B_\eps(x) \subset U$. Whence the rational rectangles are a basis for the standard topology on the plane $\RR^2$.

### Endowing a line with subspace topologies [@Mu00, number 16.8]

Consider a straight line $L$ in the plane. We'll describe the topological structure of $L$ endowed with the subspace topology of $\RR_\ell \times \RR$ and $\RR_\ell \times \RR_\ell$ respectively (where $\RR_\ell$ is the lower limit topological space, and $\RR$ is the standard topological space on the real line).

We have two trivial cases to rule out. Consider when $L \subset \RR \times \RR$ is either $\{x\}\times\RR$ or $\RR\times\{y\}$. Then $L$ is homoemorphic to the topological space in it's left (respectively right) coordinate.

Now, without loss of generality, suppose $L$ is the diagonal line through the origin.
$$L = \{(t, t) : t \in \RR\} \subset \RR \times \RR.$$

- Endow $L$ with the subspace topology from $\RR_\ell \times \RR$. We have basis elements $B$ of $\RR_\ell \times \RR$ of the form $[a,b)\times(c,d)$. Now these basis elements intersect with $L$ to produce sets of the form $$\{(t,t): a \leq t < b\} \cup \{(t,t) : c < t< d\}.$$ More concisely, since we can represent $(c,d)$ as the union of sets of the form $[a,b)$ we see that $L$ is homeomorphic to the lower limit topology. That is, $L$ has the topology generated by half open intervals $L \cap ([a,b)\times[a,b))$.
- On the other hand, endow $L$ with the subspace topology from $\RR_\ell \times \RR_\ell$. Then immediately we see $L$ has the topology generated by half open intervals $L \cap ([a,b)\times[a,b))$. 
 
### Closed sets in subspaces [@Mu00, number 17.2]

Suppose that $Y$ is closed in $X$ and $A$ is closed in $Y$ where $Y$ is given the subspace topology. To show that $A$ is closed in $X$, note that $A$ is closed in $Y$ iff $A = K\cap Y$ where $K$ is closed in $X$. But since $A \subset Y$, the only^[One should verify: Why is $A$ the *only such set*?] $X$-closed set $K$ for which $K\cap Y = A$ is $A$. So $A$ is closed in $X$.

### [@Mu00, number 17.6]

Let $A$, $B$, and $A_\alpha$ for some index $\alpha$ be subsets of a space $X$.

\newcommand{\cl}[1]{\overline{#1}}

(a) If $A \subset B$, then $\cl{A} \subset \cl{B}$.

*Proof.* Suppose that $A \subset B$. Because $B \subset \cl{B}$, we have $A \subset \cl{B}$. Since $\cl{A}$ is contained in the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$, it follows that $\cl{A} \subset \cl{B}$. \qedsymbol

(b) $\cl{A \cup B} = \cl{A} \cup \cl{B}$.

*Proof by set containment.* ($\subset$) By the previous argument we have $\cl{A} \subset \cl{A \cup B}$ and further $\cl{B} \subset \cl{A \cup B}$. Whence $\cl{A} \cup \cl{B} \subset \cl{A \cup B}$. ($\supset$) Clearly $\cl{A} \cup \cl{B} \supset A \cup B$, so we only need to consider those limit points $p$ of $A \cup B$ and argue they are contained in either $\cl{A}$ or $\cl{B}$. We show the contrapositive. Suppose that $p$ is not a limit point of $A$ or $B$. Then there exist open sets $U_A$ and $U_B$ both containing $p$ such that the intersections $U_A \cap A\setminus\{p\}$ and $U_B \cap A\setminus\{p\}$ are both nonempty. Now $p \in U_A \cap U_B$, an open set. We deduce that $(U_A \cap U_B) \cap (A \cup B)\setminus\{p\}$ is nonempty, which suffices to show that $p$ is not a limit point of $A\cup B$.
\qedsymbol

(c) $\cl{\cup A_\alpha} \supset \cup \cl{A_\alpha}$, and there's an example of proper containment.

*Proof.* Let $x \in \cup \cl{A_\alpha}$. If $x \in A_\alpha$ then clearly $x \in \cup A_\alpha \subset \cl{\cup A_\alpha}$. Suppose then that $x$ is a limit point of some $A_\alpha$. Then every open set $U \ni x$ has nontrivial intersection with $A_\alpha \setminus \{x\}$, say, at a point $y \in U\cap A_\alpha \setminus\{x\}$. Whence $y \in U\cap (\cup A_\alpha) \setminus\{x\}$. We deduce then that $x$ is a limit point of the union $\cup A_\alpha$. So $x \in \cl{\cup A_\alpha}$. \qedsymbol 

For an example of proper containment, consider $A_n = (-1 + \frac1n, 1 - \frac1n)$ in the standard topology on the real line. We have $$[-1,1] = \cl{\bigcup A_n} \supsetneq \bigcup \cl{A_n} = (-1,1).$$

### Finite products of Hausdorff spaces [@Mu00, number 17.11]

The product of two Hausdorff spaces is itself Hausdorff.

*Proof.* Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are Hausdorff spaces and consider the product space $X \times Y$. We'll show that because $X \times Y$ is component-wise Hausdorff, we have that $X \times Y$ is Hausdorff. So let $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ be distinct points in the space. Now component-wise, there are disjoint open sets $U_1, U_2$ in $X$ such that $U_1 \ni x_1, U_2 \ni x_2$ and similarly for $Y$ there are disjoint open sets $V_1, V_2$ in such that $V_1 \ni y_1, V_2 \ni y_2$. Now in the product topology, we have disjoint open sets $$U_1\times V_1 \ni (x_1, y_1) \text{ and } U_2\times V_2 \ni (x_2, y_2),$$ as desired. \qedsymbol

### Characterizing topologies on $\RR$ [@Mu00, number 17.16]

(a) We have the following table for the closure of the set $K = \{ 1/n : n \in \NN \}$ in each topology on $\RR$.

    which topology on $\RR$?| what is $\cl{K}$?
    ----- | ---------- 
    standard | $K \cup \{0\}$
    $K$-topology | $K$
    finite complement | $\RR$
    upper limit | $K$
    generated by $(-\infty, a)$ | $\RR_{\geq 0}$

(b) Further, we'll distinguish the above spaces in terms of two separation axioms. (Recall that every Hausdorff space is $T_1$.)

    which topology on $\RR$?| Hausdorff? | $T_1$?
    ----- | ----------  | ---
    standard | yes | yes
    $K$-topology | yes | yes
    finite complement | no | yes
    upper limit | yes | yes
    generated by $(-\infty, a)$ | no | no

### Closure operations [@Mu00, number 17.17]

Consider $\RR_\ell$ the lower limit topology on the reals and the topology $\sC = \{[a,b) : a < b \text{ and } a, b \in \QQ\}$. 

We have the following table for the closure of two distinct sets in the aforementioned topologies respectively.

$\quad$ | $\RR_\ell$ | $\sC$
----- | ---------- | -----
$(0, \sqrt{2})$ | $[0,\sqrt{2})$ | $[0,\sqrt{2}]$
$(\sqrt{2}, 3)$ | $[\sqrt{2}, 3)$ | $[\sqrt{2}, 3)$
