### The topology generated by a basis [@Mu00, number 13.5]

We show that if $\sA$ is a basis for a topology on $X$, then the topology generated by the $\sA$ equals the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that contain $\sA$.
Further, the same result holds if $\sA$ is a subbasis.

### Incomparable topologies on $\RR$ [@Mu00, number 13.6]

We show two topologies on the real line are not comparable, namely $\RR_\ell$, the lower limit topology generated by half open intervals $[a, b)$, and $\RR_K$, the $K$-topology generated by the punctured open intervals $(a,b) \setminus \{n^{-1} : n \in \NN\}$.

### Partially ordering topologies by inclusion [@Mu00, number 13.7]

We determine a partial ordering for the following topologies on $\RR$:

- the standard topology
- the $K$-topology
- the finite complement topology
- the upper limit topology
- the topology generated by the rays $(-\infty, a)$

### Countable bases for topologies on $\RR$ [@Mu00, number 13.8]

(a) We show that $\sB = \{(a,b) : a < b \text{ and } a, b \in \QQ\}$ is a countable basis for the standard topology on $\RR$.

(b) We'll demonstrate the collection $\sC = \{[a,b) : a < b \text{ and } a, b \in \QQ\}$ generates a topology distinct from the lower limit topology.

### Defining open sets in a subspace [@Mu00, number 16.3]

Consider the set $Y = [-1, 1]$ as a subspace of $\RR$. Which of the following sets are open in $Y$? in $\RR$?

- $\left\{ x : \frac12 < \abs{x} < 1\right\}$
- $\left\{ x : \frac12 < \abs{x} \leq 1\right\}$
- $\left\{ x : \frac12 \leq \abs{x} < 1\right\}$
- $\left\{ x : \frac12 \leq \abs{x} \leq 1\right\}$
- $\left\{ x : 0 < \abs{x} < 1 \text{ and } \frac1x \notin \NN \right\}$

### Open maps between spaces [@Mu00, number 16.4]

Consider the space $X$ and its subspace $Y$. We'll demonstrate that the projections $$\pi_1 \colon X \times Y \to X \text{ and } \pi_2 \colon X \times Y \to Y$$ are open maps.

### A countable basis for $\RR^2$ [@Mu00, number 16.6]

We'll prove that the countable collection $$\left\{(a,b) \times (c,d) : a < b \text { and } c < d \text{ and } a,b,c,d \in \QQ \right\}$$ is a basis for $\RR^2$.

### Endowing a line with subspace topologies [@Mu00, number 16.8]

Consider a straight line $L$ in the plane. We'll describe the topological structure of $L$ endowed with the subspace topology of $\RR_\ell \times \RR$ and $\RR_\ell \times \RR_\ell$ respectively.

### Closed sets in subspaces [@Mu00, number 17.2]

If $A$ is closed in $Y$ and $Y$ is closed in $X$, then $A$ is closed in $X$.

### [@Mu00, number 17.6]

Let $A$, $B$, and $A_\alpha$ denoted subsets of a space $X$.

(a) If $A \subset B$, then $\overline{A} \subset \overline{B}$.

(b) $\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$.

(c) $\overline{\cup A_\alpha} \supset \cup \overline{A_\alpha}$, and there's an example of proper containment.

### Finite products of Hausdorff spaces [@Mu00, number 17.11]

The product of two Hausdorff spaces is itself Hausdorff.

### Characterizing topologies on $\RR$ [@Mu00, number 17.16]

(a) We have the following table for the closure of the set $K = \{ 1/n : n \in \NN \}$ in each topology on $\RR$.

    which topology on $\RR$?| what is $\overline{K}$?
    ----- | ---------- 
    standard |
    $K$-topology |
    finite complement |
    upper limit |
    generated by $(-\infty, a)$ |

(b) Further, we'll distinguish the above spaces in terms of two separation axioms.

    which topology on $\RR$?| Hausdorff? | $T_1$?
    ----- | ----------  | ---
    standard | |
    $K$-topology | |
    finite complement | |
    upper limit | |
    generated by $(-\infty, a)$ | |

### Closure operations [@Mu00, number 17.17]

Consider $\RR_\ell$ the lower limit topology on the reals and the topology $\sC = \{[a,b) : a < b \text{ and } a, b \in \QQ\}$. 

We have the following table for the closure of two distinct sets in the aforementioned topologies respectively.

\star | $\RR_\ell$ | $\sC$
----- | ---------- | -----
$(0, \sqrt{2})$ | | 
$(\sqrt{2}, 3)$ | |
--->
