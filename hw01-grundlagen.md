### The topology generated by a basis [@Mu00, number 13.5]

If $\sB$ is a basis for a topology on $X$, then the topology generated by $\sB$ equals the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that contain $\sB$. 

    *Proof by set inclusion.* ($\subset$) Suppose $\sB$ is a basis for and $\sT_\sB$ is the topology generated by $\sB$, i.e., the set of unions of of families of $B_i \in \sB$. Now, if $U$ is open in $\sT_\sB$, then $U = \cup B_i$. If $\sT_j$ is any other topology on $X$ such that $\sT_j \supset \sB$, because $\sT_j$ is closed under unions of open sets, we have $$\sT_j \ni \cup B_i = U.$$ So $\sT_\sB \subset \sT_j$ for all topologies $\sT_j \supset \sB$ on $X$. Hence $$\sT_\sB \subset \cap_{\forall\sT_j \supset \sB} \sT_j.$$

    ($\supset$) Now suppose that the open set $V \in \cap_{\forall\sT_j \supset \sB} \sT_j$. We need to show that $V \in \sT_\sB$. But $V \in \sT_j$ for all topologies containing $\sB$. Since $\sT_\sB \supset \sB$ by construction, we have $V \in \sT_\sB$. Hence $\sT_\sB \supset \cap_{\forall\sT_j \supset \sB} \sT_j$. \qedsymbol

Further, the same result holds if $\sA$ is a subbasis.

*Proof by set inclusion*. ($\subset$) Let $U$ be an open set in the topology generated by $\sA$, denoted $\sT_\sA$. Then $U$ is the union of finite intersections of sets $A_i$ in the subbasis. Now note that if $\sT_j$ is a topology on $X$ and $\sT_j \supset \sT$, because $\sT_j$ is closed under unions and finite intersections, we have $U \in \sT_j$. So $\sT_\sA$ for all such topologies on $X$ containing the subbasis. Whence $$\sT_\sA \subset \cap_{\sT_j \supset \sA} \sT_j.$$ 

($\supset$) Let $U \in \sT_j$ for all topologies $\sT_j$ containing $\sA$. Clearly $\sT_\sA$ is one such topology. So $U \in \sT_\sA$. Whence $\sT_\sA \subset \cap_{\sT_j \supset \sA} \sT_j$. \qedsymbol

### Incomparable topologies on $\RR$ [@Mu00, number 13.6]

We show two topologies on the real line are not comparable, namely $\RR_\ell$, the lower limit topology generated by half open intervals $[a, b)$, and $\RR_K$, the $K$-topology generated by the punctured open intervals $(a,b) \setminus \{n^{-1} : n \in \NN\}$.

### Partially ordering topologies by inclusion [@Mu00, number 13.7]

We determine a partial ordering for the following topologies on $\RR$:

- the standard topology
- the $K$-topology
- the finite complement topology
- the upper limit topology
- the topology generated by the rays $(-\infty, a)$

### Countable bases for topologies on $\RR$ [@Mu00, number 13.8]

(a) We show that $\sB = \{(a,b) : a < b \text{ and } a, b \in \QQ\}$ is a countable basis for the standard topology on $\RR$.

(b) We'll demonstrate the collection $\sC = \{[a,b) : a < b \text{ and } a, b \in \QQ\}$ generates a topology distinct from the lower limit topology.

### Defining open sets in a subspace [@Mu00, number 16.3]

Consider the set $Y = [-1, 1]$ as a subspace of $\RR$. Which of the following sets are open in $Y$? in $\RR$?

- $\left\{ x : \frac12 < \abs{x} < 1\right\}$
- $\left\{ x : \frac12 < \abs{x} \leq 1\right\}$
- $\left\{ x : \frac12 \leq \abs{x} < 1\right\}$
- $\left\{ x : \frac12 \leq \abs{x} \leq 1\right\}$
- $\left\{ x : 0 < \abs{x} < 1 \text{ and } \frac1x \notin \NN \right\}$

### Open maps between spaces [@Mu00, number 16.4]

Consider a space $X$ and its subspace $Y$. The projections $$\pi_1 \colon X \times Y \to X \text{ and } \pi_2 \colon X \times Y \to Y$$ are open maps.

*Proof.* Suppose $U\times V$ is open in $X\times Y$ (so $U$ and $V$ are open in $X$ and $Y$ respectively). Then $\pi_1(U\times V) = U$ is open in $X$, and $\pi(U\times V) = V$ is open in $Y$. Since open sets are mapped to open sets by both projections, we say both projections are *open maps*. \qedsymbol

### A countable basis for $\RR^2$ [@Mu00, number 16.6]

The countable collection $$\left\{(a,b) \times (c,d) : a < b \text { and } c < d \text{ and } a,b,c,d \in \QQ \right\}$$ is a basis for $\RR^2$.

*Proof.* We are to show that for an arbitrary open $U \in \RR^2$, for each $x \in U$ there's a rational rectangle containing $x$ and embedded in $U$. Now, the open balls are a basis for $\RR^2$, so we know there exists and $\eps > 0$ such that $x \in B_\eps(x) \subset U$. We need to fit our rational rectangle within $B_\eps(x)$.

Now, consider the vector form of $x$ as $(x_1,x_2)^T$. Choose a rational $r = (r_1,r_2)^T$ such that $\frac{\eps}{3\sqrt{2}} > \max\{\abs{x_1-r_1, x_2 - r_2}\}$.

### Endowing a line with subspace topologies [@Mu00, number 16.8]

Consider a straight line $L$ in the plane. We'll describe the topological structure of $L$ endowed with the subspace topology of $\RR_\ell \times \RR$ and $\RR_\ell \times \RR_\ell$ respectively.

### Closed sets in subspaces [@Mu00, number 17.2]

If $A$ is closed in $Y$ and $Y$ is closed in $X$, then $A$ is closed in $X$.

### [@Mu00, number 17.6]

Let $A$, $B$, and $A_\alpha$ denoted subsets of a space $X$.

(a) If $A \subset B$, then $\overline{A} \subset \overline{B}$.

(b) $\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$.

(c) $\overline{\cup A_\alpha} \supset \cup \overline{A_\alpha}$, and there's an example of proper containment.

### Finite products of Hausdorff spaces [@Mu00, number 17.11]

The product of two Hausdorff spaces is itself Hausdorff.

### Characterizing topologies on $\RR$ [@Mu00, number 17.16]

(a) We have the following table for the closure of the set $K = \{ 1/n : n \in \NN \}$ in each topology on $\RR$.

    which topology on $\RR$?| what is $\overline{K}$?
    ----- | ---------- 
    standard |
    $K$-topology |
    finite complement |
    upper limit |
    generated by $(-\infty, a)$ |

(b) Further, we'll distinguish the above spaces in terms of two separation axioms.

    which topology on $\RR$?| Hausdorff? | $T_1$?
    ----- | ----------  | ---
    standard | |
    $K$-topology | |
    finite complement | |
    upper limit | |
    generated by $(-\infty, a)$ | |

### Closure operations [@Mu00, number 17.17]

Consider $\RR_\ell$ the lower limit topology on the reals and the topology $\sC = \{[a,b) : a < b \text{ and } a, b \in \QQ\}$. 

We have the following table for the closure of two distinct sets in the aforementioned topologies respectively.

\star | $\RR_\ell$ | $\sC$
----- | ---------- | -----
$(0, \sqrt{2})$ | | 
$(\sqrt{2}, 3)$ | |
