### [@Mu00, number 23.1]

Let $\sT$ and $\sT'$ be two topologies on $X$. If $\sT \supset \sT'$, what does connectedness of $X$ in one topology imply about connectedness in the other?

### [@Mu00, number 23.4]

If $X$ is an infinite set, it is connected in the finite complement topology.

\newpage

### [@Mu00, number 23.5]

If $X$ has the discrete topology, then $X$ is totally disconnected. The converse does not hold.

### [@Mu00, number 23.7]

$\RR_\ell$ is a totally disconnected space.

\newpage

### [@Mu00, number 23.11]

Let $p \colon X \to Y$ be a quotient map. If each set $p^{-1}(\{y\})$ is connected, and if $Y$ is connected, then $X$ is connected.

### [@Mu00, number 24.1]

Let $f \colon S^1 \to \RR$ be a continuous map. We exhibit a point $x$ of $S^1$ such that $f(x) = f(-x)$.

\newpage

### [@Mu00, number 24.2]

Let $f \colon X \to X$ be a continuous transformation of $X$. If $X = [0,1]$, then there's a point such that $f(x) = x$. There are continuous transformations of $[0,1)$ and $(0,1)$ without fixed points.

### [@Mu00, number 24.7]

(a) Let $X$ and $Y$ be ordered sets in the order topology. If $f \colon X \to Y$ is order preserving and surjective, then $f$ is a homeomorphism.

(b) Let $X = Y = \RR_{\ge 0}$. Given any positive integer $n$, the function $f\colon X \to Y$ defined by $f(x) := x^n$ is order preserving and surjective. Moreover, $f$ has a continuous inverse $f^{-1} \colon Y \to X$ given by $f^{-1}(y):= \sqrt[ n ]{y}$.

\newpage

### [@Mu00, number 24.10]

If $U$ is an *open* connected subspace of $\RR^2$, then $U$ is path connected.

### [@Mu00, number 25.2]

(a) What are the components and path components of $\RR^\omega$ (in the product topology)?

(b) Let $\RR^\omega$ have the uniform topology. Now $x$ and $y$ lie in the same component of $\RR^\omega$ if and only if the sequence $x- y = (x_1 - y_1, x_2 - y_2, \ldots )$ is bounded.

(c) Suppose $\RR^\omega$ has the box topology. Then $x$ and $y$ lie in the same component of $\RR^\omega$ if and only if the sequence $x - y$ is eventually zero.

\newpage

### [@Mu00, number 25.4] 

Let $X$ be locally path connected. Then every connected open set in $X$ is path connected.
