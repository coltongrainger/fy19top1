### [@Mu00, number 26.1]

Let $\sT$ and $\sT'$ be two topologies on the set $X$; suppose that $\sT \supset \sT$. 

(a) What does compactness of $X$ under one of these topologies imply about compactness under the other?

(b) If $X$ is compact Hausdorff under both $\sT$ and $\sT'$, then either $\sT$ and $\sT'$ are equal or they are not comparable.

### [@Mu00, number 26.5]

Let $A$ and $B$ be disjoint compact subspaces of the Hausdorff space $X$. There exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ containing $A$ and $B$, respectively.

### [@Mu00, number 26.7]

If $Y$ is compact, then the projection $\pi_1 \colon X \times Y \to X$ is a closed map.

### [@Mu00, number 26.11]

Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Let $\sA$ be a collection of closed connected subsets of $X$ that is simply ordered by proper inclusion. Then $$Y = \bigcap_{A \in \sA} A$$ is connected. 

**Lemma.** In the setup above, if $C \cup D$ is a separation of $Y$, we can choose disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ of $X$ containing $C$ and $D$, respectively, where $$\bigcap_{A\in \sA}\left(A \setminus (U \cup V)\right) \neq \emptyset.$$

### [@Mu00, number 26.12]

Let $p \colon X \to Y$ be a closed continuous surjective map such that $p^{-1}(\{y\})$ is compact, for each $y \in Y$ (such a map is called a *perfect map*). If $Y$ is compact, then $X$ is compact.

**Lemma.** In the setup above, if $U$ is an open set containing $p^{-1}(\{y\})$, there is a neighborhood $W$ of $y$ such that $p^{-1}(W)$ is contained in $U$.
