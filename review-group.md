## Overview

- Emailed folks on 2018-10-05 to rally up interest.
- Jonathan Wise ran the pillar course for Topology in 2012: <http://math.colorado.edu/~jonathan.wise/teaching/math6210-fall-2012/>.
- It's a bit late to dive as deeply into the subject as they did in their course, but I think we'll put forward sufficient effort.
